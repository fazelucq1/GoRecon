# GoRecon

Welcome to **GoRecon**, a professional tool written in Go that allows you to find servers running a specified service (e.g., Gophish), take screenshots of their websites, and generate an elegant report using Tailwind CSS. Perfect for researchers, security professionals, and web enthusiasts!

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Server Search**: Uses the Shodan API to find servers running the requested service.
- **Automated Screenshots**: Takes screenshots of websites using `chromedp`, a Chrome-based engine.
- **Stylish Report**: Generates an HTML report with Tailwind CSS, making it easy to read and visually appealing.
